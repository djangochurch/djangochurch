            <h3>Designed templates</h3>
            <p>We all know that design is important. You may not be selling things online, but your website still needs to present an image to the world that reflects your Church's values and aspirations. Django Church comes a number of professionally designed and built templates for you to choose from - each with a character of its own and a colour palette to match. And because Django Church is open source, with the right tools and skills, you could build your own template.</p>

            <h3>Powerfully simple managment tools</h3>
            <p>We can't all be Hillsongs, HTB or St Paul's - and we wouldn't want to be. They are much bigger Churches than most, and their needs are quite different. Most Churches don't need ticket purchasing systems, ecommerce, membership areas, polling and rota management tools. But when you buy into many other Church-focused website systems, there they all are; complicating things and getting in the way. And you'll always have that sneaking suspicion you're paying for something you're not using.</p>

            <p>Direct experience has taught us that most small Church websites only need a handful of key features. But if you need a little more, Django Church is designed to make bolting in new features and apps super-easy. What's more, because it's open source, a new feature developed by one Church can be shared with the whole community and added to another's site with little effort.</p>

            <h3>Tools</h3>
            <p>Being able to control and manage the content presented through your website is incredibly importent. Django Church's suite of powerful tools put you in the driving-seat. There's no charges for changes, because you can make the changes yourself without need for a developer to do them for you.</p>
            <p>The current feature-list includes...</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span>Administration user and group management</span></li>
                <li><span>Upload and storage of images and files for use on, and dowload through your site</span></li>
                <li><span>Management of weekly and special events</span></li>
                <li><span>News and blogs that let's you publish articles and stories to your own timescale</span></li>
                <li><span>Navigation, pages and the page content its self</span></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Whether you have a site that needs to be updated once a quarter or once an hour, Django Church enables you.</p>
